*bronx* stands for "Bunch of Reusable Objects Not in vorteX". It is a collection
of basic utilities that can be used in various projects.

Originally, it has been developed as part of the *Vortex* project. Recently
the  code has been extracted from the *Vortex* code base. It is now presented
as an independent Python package.
